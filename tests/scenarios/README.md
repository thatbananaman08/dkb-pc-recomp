# Scenarios

A scenario is a scripted game run that `tools/scenario.py` checks without anyone playing. This folder holds its
description, `<name>.toml`; the save it starts from is private and lives in `build/saves/<save>/`, which git ignores.

## The file

```toml
description = "what the run shows, in one line"
save = "tutorial-cave"                       # build/saves/tutorial-cave/
input = "tools/input/dkb-title-to-save.txt"  # button timings from the title screen into the save (no game data)
seconds = 75                                 # game time to run; the last frame is checked

[env]                                        # optional: settings for every run of this scenario
# TOTK_FIX_VS_FAULT = "0"

[checks]
min_fps = 50          # a 60-frame window under this is slow
hitch_ms = 100        # a frame over this is a hitch (counted, not failed)
skip_world = 5        # seconds of game time left out at the start (the scene loading)
perf = "SLOW"         # fail on a SLOW verdict; "HITCHY" fails on short dips too; leave it out to not judge speed
max_black = 0.10      # fail when more of the last frame below the HUD is near-black
hud_band = 0.15       # the top share of the frame that holds the HUD
min_hud_bright = 0.005  # under this the last frame is not gameplay (a black loading screen), and is not judged;
                        # a bright sky passes it too, so outdoors it does not tell gameplay from a bright menu
warp = "HillLevelStage" # optional: start in this stage instead of the save's (tools/save_warp.py)

[variants.native_gs]  # --ab native_gs alternates these
off = { DKB_NATIVE_GS = "0" }
on = { DKB_NATIVE_GS = "1" }
```

## Another area without another save

`warp = "<stage>"` in the file (or `--warp <stage>` on the command line) starts each run in that stage: the runner
rewrites the stage in the run's copy of the save with `tools/save_warp.py`. `--sweep <regex>` runs once per matching
stage (`'LevelStage$'`: the 20 layers). `python tools/save_warp.py --stages` lists the names. Measured on 1.0.0: the
tutorial-cave save warped to `HillLevelStage` loads that stage and reaches gameplay. The source save's progress comes
along, so a later stage may not start as real play would; for those, a real save from that point is still better.

## The save

1. Get the game to the point you want, on your console or in a run, and save.
2. Copy that profile's `account.uid` and `save/` folder into `build/saves/<save>/`. A run's profile is kept with
   `python tools/scenario.py <name> --keep-profile` (in `build/scenarios/.../profile/`).
3. `python tools/scenario.py --list` says whether the save is found.

Without its save a scenario is skipped (exit 77, SKIP in `tools/test.py`), never failed.

## The input

`tools/input/*.txt`: one step per line, `<frame> <buttons> <frames held>`, for `TOTK_INPUT_SCRIPT`. Frames count from
the start of the process, so a slow start (a cold shader cache, a busy machine) shifts where they land. Record a session
with `TOTK_INPUT_RECORD` (see `tools/run_game.py`) to get one from real play.

## Choosing the checks

Calibrate on a known-good and a known-bad run: run the scenario with `--repeat 2` on both builds, read
`result.json`'s `black_share`, `hud_bright` and `fps`, and put the limits between them with room on both sides. Note the
measured values in a comment, as `tutorial-cave.toml` does.
